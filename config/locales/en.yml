          <strong>Know where and when how many helpers show up!</strong>
          Publish specific help-requests, when, where how many helpers are needed. Divide your events into shifts where helpers can directly sign up for via the web application or the Where2Help mobile apps.
          You always keep an overview on how many helpers have signed up to help.
          Looking forward to you!
